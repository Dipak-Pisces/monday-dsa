Simple Questions

    1) Flatten a list of lists of integers: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] into a single list of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

    2) Convert a List<String[]> (e.g., [{"apple", "banana"}, {"cat", "dog"}]) into a List<String>: ["apple", "banana", "cat", "dog"].

    3) Flatten a List<int[]> (e.g., [{1, 2}, {3, 4}]) into a single list of integers.

Intermediate Questions

    4) Flatten a map's values into a single list. For example, given a map:
    {1 -> [2, 3], 4 -> [5, 6]} flatten it into [2, 3, 5, 6].

    5) Given a LinkedList<LinkedList<String>>, flatten it into a List<String> while filtering out empty inner lists.

    6) Flatten a List<String> where each string represents a sentence, into a List<String> of individual words.
    Input: ["Hello world", "Java streams"]
    Output: ["Hello", "world", "Java", "streams"].

Advanced Questions

    7) Flatten a stream of arrays into a single list while filtering elements divisible by 3.
    Input: [{1, 3, 6}, {9, 2, 8}]
    Output: [3, 6, 9].

    8) Flatten a list of arrays, sort the result in descending order, and collect into a LinkedList.
    Input: [{5, 2}, {3, 8, 1}]
    Output: [8, 5, 3, 2, 1].
